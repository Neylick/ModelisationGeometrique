# Modélisation Géométrique
(For now) Objects are constructed on startup, meaning the "game" needs to be restarted to change parameters.
Positions can be altered via inspector in game and are updated.
The scene can be easily navigated in the *Scene* window (and not *Game* window).
## TP1
Scripts : (`*.cs`)
- CustomQuad
- CustomPlane
- CustomSphere
- CustomCylinder
- CustomCone
Every script can be attached to an empty object and has Serialized Fields for parameters.
